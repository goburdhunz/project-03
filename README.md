## Brief
* **Work in a pre-desginated group of 4**
* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use an Express API** to serve your data from a Mongo database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers. **ALLOW** time for this.
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.
* **Have automated tests** for _at least_ one RESTful resource on the back-end. Improve your employability by demonstrating a good understanding of testing principals.

## Approach


We started off with discussing ideas within the group and as soon as we had settled on a burger rating website, we started wireframing on a whiteboard.

After the initial project setup, we started to look at the database models and schema. Then we started to build out the back-end. With every endpoint we created, the other half of the team would build out the connected front-end. We also used NPM packages for some features such as the modals and rating slider.  I chose to work on the Express backend, setting up the backend of the app; controllers, routing, mongoose models and basic token authentication. I also implemented a modal display on the frontend using a specific NPM package component and implemented comments on the details page of the app.

## Unsolved problems or Major hurdle

- The main problem was time - I was ill for 3 days during the main project week which meant my team was down by one person so in the end, we implemented less than we had originally wanted. 
- Another issue was not agreeing beforehand what we wanted the website styling to look like, so it was left a bit late in the week.

## Learnings

- Working as a team on a group project using github and git branches
- Managing work and tickets using Trello
- Practice with React and Node.js/Express.js
- Mongoose Models
- Embedded / referenced data within the models
