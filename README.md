## Brief
* **Work in a pre-desginated group of 4**
* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use an Express API** to serve your data from a Mongo database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers. **ALLOW** time for this.
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.
* **Have automated tests** for _at least_ one RESTful resource on the back-end. Improve your employability by demonstrating a good understanding of testing principals.

## Approach


We started off with discussing ideas within the group and as soon as we had settled on a burger rating website, we started wireframing on a whiteboard.

After the initial project setup, we started to look at the database models and schema. Then we started to build out the back-end. With every endpoint we created, the other half of the team would build out the connected front-end. We also used NPM packages for some features such as the modals and rating slider.  I chose to work on the Express backend, setting up the backend of the app; controllers, routing, mongoose models and basic token authentication. I also implemented a modal display on the frontend using a specific NPM package component and implemented comments on the details page of the app.

## Unsolved problems or Major hurdle

- The main problem was time - I was ill for 3 days during the main project week which meant my team was down by one person so in the end, we implemented less than we had originally wanted. 
- Another issue was not agreeing beforehand what we wanted the website styling to look like, so it was left a bit late in the week.

## Wins 

- Building a full-stack app in 7 days!
- Working as a team with others on Github and working through problems together
- Understanding React and Node that much more.
- Used NPM packages more and learnt how powerful and convenient they can be

## Key Learnings

- Working as a team on a group project using github and git branches - this is a key component of working a software development team and it was great practice to manage the development process all on Github. 
- Managing work and tickets using Trello - I was used to working with Jira and managing work with tickets so it made sense to use the same system on Trello - However, the process only works when people use the tickets as they should be used - to let others know what they are working on and their progress - this needs to be a uniformed approach, otherwise the management system does not work.
- React and Node.js/Express.js - Building a full-stack app with React and Node felt like a culmination of everything we had been working on for he past couple of weeks. I persoanlly really enjoyed Node - it seemed very accessible and simple to get started with. 
- MongoDB/NOSQL / Mongoose Models - Also really enjoyed MongoDB - it felt and looked like JSON which is what we use all the time. This made it easier to work with and to understand. Also, the Mongoose ORM layer really helped to show how the backend communicates with the database and how simple it really can be. 
- Embedded / referenced data within the models - Simple compared to SQL and Mongoose really made it very readable.
